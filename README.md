# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis


## Overview of Project
Background: 

Now that Bobby has proven his SQL chops, his manager has given both of you two more assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, you’ll write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

### Purpose

Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
Deliverable 2: The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program
Deliverable 3: A written report on the employee database analysis 


## Results

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

## Summary 

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?


### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
