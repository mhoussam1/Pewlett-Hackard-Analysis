# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis


## Overview of Project
Background: 

Now that Bobby has proven his SQL chops, his manager has given both of you two more assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, you’ll write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

### Purpose

- Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
- Deliverable 2: The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program
- Deliverable 3: A written report on the employee database analysis 


## Results

- As seen from the results in the table above we can see that there is a big percentage of people that are eligble for retierment at 30%. 
- The biggeset job title is senior engineer, as it is losing around twenty nine thousand. 

## Employees eligiable for mentorship program:

- There were only 1549 employees that met the mentorship requirments.
- There is a huge difference of how many employees reaching the retierment requirments than the mentorship, with more than eighty eight thousand more employees. 




## Summary 

### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?


- If employees were to retire at the age of 65, there would be roughly 22,600  leaving the company each year.

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

- There is not enough qualified mentors to be able to reach the potential needed. there will need to be changes in the requirments such as changing the age requirment to be able to get nmore mentors ready.
